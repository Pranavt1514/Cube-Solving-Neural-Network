# Cube-Solving-Neural-Network
A Jupyter Notebook python project of a Rubik's Cube simulation. I have created a rubik's cube class which can perform functions like scrambles, checking if the cube is solved and also generate the string which gives the moves to solve the cube. I am currently working on a neural network to generate the solution without the need to store them.
